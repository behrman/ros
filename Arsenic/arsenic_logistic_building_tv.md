### Background

#### Data on all wells

Data on arsenic level in all wells and their location.

``` r

  transmute(arsenic = as / 100, x, y)

summary(wells_all)
```

    #> 0.01 0.09 0.56 1.36 2.54 3.26 4.83 9.65

There are some outliers with levels up to 9.65, but the majority of the
wells have levels under 3.

``` r
v <- mean(wells_all$arsenic > 0.5)
v
```

    #> [1] 0.524

About 52.4% of wells are unsafe; that is, have arsenic levels over 0.5.

    type = if_else(arsenic > 0.5, "Unsafe wells", "Safe wells"),
    arsenic = if_else(arsenic > 3, 3, arsenic)
  ) %>%

It looks as though the wells may be near dwellings along streets. In
many areas unsafe wells are close to safe wells.

The variables are:

-   `switch`: Outcome variable:
    -   1 if household switched to a new well
    -   0 if household continued using its own well
-   `arsenic`: Arsenic level of respondentâ€™s well
-   `dist`: Distance (in meters) to the closest known safe well
-   `dist100` = `dist / 100`
-   `assoc`: Whether any members of the household are active in
    community organizations
-   `educ`: Education level of the head of household
-   `educ4` = `educ / 4`

``` r

About 57.5% of households switched.

The median distance to a safe well is about 37 meters. About 90% of the
households have a safe well within 100 meters.

##### 2D EDA

Percentage of households who switched to new well by arsenic level.

``` r
wells %>% 
  ggplot(aes(arsenic, switch)) +
  stat_ydensity(
    aes(group = switch),
    width = 0.25,
    draw_quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75),
    scale = "count"
  ) +
  geom_smooth() +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-0.125, 1.125)) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.1),
    minor_breaks = NULL,
    labels = scales::label_percent(accuracy = 1)
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::breaks_width(1)) +
  labs(
    title = 
      "Percentage of households who switched to new well by arsenic level",
    subtitle =
      "Voilin plots represent density of those do did and did not switch",
    x = "Arsenic level",
    y = "Percentage of households who switched"
  )
```

<img src="arsenic_logistic_building_tv_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="100%" />

As expected, the percentage of households increases with the arsenic
level in their well, from about 40% for wells that are just over the
safety threshold to perhaps 80% for very high levels. The sparse data
for high arsenic levels results in a large uncertainty.

Percentage of households who switched to new well by distance.

``` r
wells %>% 
  ggplot(aes(dist, switch)) +
  stat_ydensity(
    aes(group = switch),
    width = 0.25,
    draw_quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75),
    scale = "count"
  ) +
  geom_smooth() +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-0.125, 1.125)) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.1),
    minor_breaks = NULL,
    labels = scales::label_percent(accuracy = 1)
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::breaks_width(50)) +
  labs(
    title = "Percentage of households who switched to new well by distance",
    subtitle =
      "Voilin plots represent density of those do did and did not switch",
    x = "Distance to the closest known safe well (meters)",
    y = "Percentage of households who switched"
  )
```

<img src="arsenic_logistic_building_tv_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="100%" />

As expected, the percentage of households decreases with the distance to
the closest known safe well, from about 60% when a safe well is very
close to perhaps 20% when a safe well is far away. The sparse data for
large distances results in a large uncertainty.

The empirical plot in the 2D EDA section showed that about 60% of
households switched at the closest distance and about 20% switched at
the farthest distance. The probabilities of the model at the extremes
are similar. Between the distance of 0 - 50 meters, the empirical plot
has a roughly constant percentage of households who switched, whereas
the model has a steady decline.

### Interpreting the logistic regression coefficients

Proportion of households who switched.

``` r
switch_prop <- mean(wells$switch)

switch_prop
```

    #> [1] 0.575

Log score for model with a constant prediction equal to the proportion
of households who switched.

``` r
log(switch_prop) * sum(wells$switch) + log(1 - switch_prop) * sum(!wells$switch)
```

    #> [1] -2059

Since the LOO log score for the model with distance is -2040, distance
supplies some predictive information.

### Adding a second input variable

Fit a model using scaled distance and arsenic level.

``` r
set.seed(733)

fit_3 <- 
  stan_glm(
    switch ~ dist100 + arsenic,
    family = binomial(link = "logit"),
    data = wells,
    refresh = 0
  )

fit_3
```

    #> fit_3   0.0       0.0  
    #> fit_2 -71.7      12.2

Model 3 has the better log score, indicating that including arsenic
level in the model clearly improves the predictive accuracy.

there is no need to keep it in the model for predictive purposes (unless
new information can be obtained).

Belonging to a community association, perhaps surprisingly, is
associated in our data with a *lower* probability of switching, after
adjusting for the other factors in the model. However, this coefficient
is not estimated precisely, and so for clarity and stability we remove
it from the model.

Adding the interactions with education in model 8 improves predictive
performance over model 7.

``` r
loo_compare(loo_3, loo_8)
```

    #>       elpd_diff se_diff
    #> fit_8   0.0       0.0  
    #> fit_3 -15.8       6.3

The education variable and its interactions in model 8 substantially
improves predictive performance over model 3.

### Simulating the uncertainty in the estimated coefficients

Posterior draws of logistic regression coefficients.

``` r
sims_2 <- as_tibble(fit_2)
coef <- 
  tibble(
    `(Intercept)` = coef(fit_2)[["(Intercept)"]],
    dist100 = coef(fit_2)[["dist100"]]
  )

sims_2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(`(Intercept)`, dist100)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.1) +
  geom_point(data = coef, color = "red", size = 1.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Posterior draws of logistic regression coefficients"

Probability of household switching to new well by distance with
uncertainty: With 50% and 90% predictive intervals.

In the region of sparse data for large distances, the uncertainty from
the posterior distribution of the model is much less than the
uncertainty seen in the [2D EDA section](#2d-eda) using LOESS.
